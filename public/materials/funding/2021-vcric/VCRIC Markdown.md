[LINK TO NOFO PACKET](VCRIC2021NOFOPacket.zip) {.text-center .nofo-link}

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting grant proposals for Violent Crime Reduction in Illinois Communities (VCRIC) program grants. A total of $1 million in FFY19 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funding is available through this solicitation for use over a period of 36 months. Grants will support programs designed to reduce violence crime, specifically domestic violence and gun violence.

**Application deadline: July 26, 2021.**

## Program Requirements

The Violent Crime Reduction in Illinois Communities Program was established as a funding goal in the 2019-2024 JAG Strategic Plan. Funding will be used to support evidence-informed or promising practices in violent crime reduction initiatives that target underlying drivers of violence and are tailored to the unique characteristics of violence occurring in Illinois’ diverse communities.

Proposed programs must address either domestic violence or gun violence. This program requires a collaborative structure. A collaborative is not a separate organization, but rather a partnership or coalition of multiple partner organizations that will work together to successfully meet the goals of the program. The collaborative structure must consist of one applicant taking on the responsibility of being the passthrough entity and entering into an agreement with ICJIA. The other collaborative partners will be program subgrantees. The principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion must be demonstrated in the proposed program among the partners of the collaborative and program activity. Applicants must also include the four principles of procedural justice in their program design. Evidence-informed or promising practice must be implemented in program design and address implementation barriers as they arise. These and other program requirements are described in detail in the full Notice of Funding Opportunity.

## Eligibility Information

Agencies must be pre-qualified through the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) Grantee Portal, [https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/), to become eligible to apply for an award. Applicants must be in good standing with all GATA pre-qualification requirements and received approval of the Internal Control Questionnaire (ICQ) SFY22, and Programmatic Risk Assessment, before the execution of the grant agreement.

## Eligible Applicants

Eligible applicants must be part of a collaborative partnership. The collaborative must consist of a passthrough entity and subgrantee partner(s). Collaborative partners must be an Illinois government entity or community-based organization that provides either domestic violence services in their communities or focuses on reduction of gun violence and can demonstrate strong ties to the communities they serve. These and other applicant requirements are described in detail in the full Notice of Funding Opportunity.
