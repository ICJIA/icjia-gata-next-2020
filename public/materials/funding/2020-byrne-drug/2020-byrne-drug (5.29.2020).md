## Notice of Funding Opportunity FFY17 and FFY18 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant: Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Drugs

[LINK TO NOFO](CompLEDrugNOFO.pdf) {.text-center .nofo-link}

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting proposals for grants to support comprehensive law enforcement responses to drugs. Grants will be made with FFY17 and FFY18 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funds. A total of $3.5 million in funding will be made available to support the JAG goal of reducing substance misuse and availability in Illinois communities.

**Application deadline: 11:59 p.m., June 15, 2020**

## Program Requirements

Applicants may request funding under one or more categories of funding. A separate application must be completed for each category. 

#### Category 1: Law Enforcement Deflection Programs

To be eligible for funding, deflection programs must:

- Be run by a local law enforcement agency, county sheriff’s department, or a multi-jurisdictional cooperative law enforcement unit for which an Implementing Agency has been identified. 
  - An Implementing Agency in this context is a government agency which will, on behalf of the multi-jurisdictional unit, apply for the grant, enter into the inter-governmental grant agreement with ICJIA, accept and account for grant funds, and meet all ICJIA reporting and compliance requirements.
- Collaborate and partner with other police departments, if needed, to generate a wider pool of participants. Options may include:
    - Sheriff’s departments.
    - Single police departments that have sufficient volume within their own jurisdiction.
    - A collaboration between multiple police departments where one agency serves as the lead and memorandums of understanding exist to show that one department will provide treatment coordination services to other jurisdictions. Partner agencies will refer participants to the lead and benefit from having the program as an option for their communities.
- Have a full-time service coordinator. The coordinator will provide screening, intake, assessment of insurance coverage, and case management to program participants, and serve as a liaison with treatment providers to secure placements. The coordinator will also facilitate a “warm handoff” when clients arrive at the treatment center. A warm-handoff features a professional (coordinator, officer or trained volunteer) offering a face-to-face introduction of the client to the treatment provider.
- Utilize the self-referral model with outreach. The program coordinator and police department must identify potential participants through community outreach, including speaking engagements to community organizations, churches, and health care providers, and establishing a presence in the community by reaching out in areas where potential participants or their families may be and offering information. The model must include:
  - A plan to make potential clients and referral sources aware of the services available. 
  - A plan to coordinate program activities with community agencies in the service area, including substance abuse treatment, medical care and supportive service providers as well as relevant government agencies.
- Provide training of police officers and development of intake protocol. The program must train officers on substance use disorders and the development of a protocol that will be followed when potential participants present at the police department.
- Provide follow-up and aftercare. The program must follow-up with participants after treatment to determine if further services or case management are needed. 
- Provide alternative options for potential participants when treatment beds or services are not available. Ideally, the service coordinator will be able to place participants with treatment providers with whom they have established relationships. If need exceeds the number of available placements, the program must stay engaged with participants, encourage harm reduction strategies, or refer to a health care provider to maintain client contact and manage their needs until services become available. 
- Deflection community outreach expenses may not exceed 10% of total budget for paid media advertising, including website development.

#### Category 2: Drug prosecution units

To be eligible for funding, drug prosecution programs must:

- Be run by a county state’s attorney’s office or the Office of the State’s Attorney’s Appellate Prosecutor.
- Provide a memorandum of understanding demonstrating collaborative involvement with one or more drug trafficking enforcement units (Defined in Category 3).

#### Category 3: Multi-Jurisdictional Large-Scale Drug Trafficking Enforcement

To be eligible for funding, drug trafficking enforcement programs must:

- Be run by a cooperative unit comprised of three or more law enforcement agencies for which an Implementing Agency has been identified.
  - An Implementing Agency in this context is a government agency which will, on behalf of the multi-jurisdictional unit, apply for the grant, enter into the inter-governmental grant agreement with ICJIA, accept and account for grant funds, and meet all ICJIA reporting and compliance requirements.
- Have a written interagency agreement between all participating agencies defining activities and responsibilities. 
- Provide a memorandum of understanding demonstrating collaborative involvement with drug prosecution toward meeting the program’s goals and objectives. 
- Have a plan of intelligence sharing via computerized networking.
- Have a plan for forfeiture sharing, including how funds will be used. 
- Provide a letter of commitment to staffing the program from each participating agency. 
- Provide a plan for submitting current task force personnel rosters with updated personnel status for U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance Center for Task Force Integrity and Leadership training. 

#### Additional Requirements: Law Enforcement Task Forces

The U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance requires every member of a law enforcement drug enforcement unit supported with these funds who is a task force commander, agency executive, task force officer, or other task force member of equivalent rank to complete an online task force training once during the life of the grant award.
