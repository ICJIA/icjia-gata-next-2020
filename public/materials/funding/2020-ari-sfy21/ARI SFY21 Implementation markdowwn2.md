The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting proposals for Adult Redeploy Illinois Program Implementation grants. Grants will be made with SFY21 Adult Redeploy Illinois funds. A total of approximately \$9 million in funding is available through this solicitation for use over a period of 12 months.

**Application deadline: April 14, 2020.**

## Program Requirements

This funding opportunity is intended to support local jurisdictionsâ€™ efforts to safely divert individuals from prison to more effective and less expensive community-based supervision and services by providing funding and technical assistance. Results expected from ARI include reduced prison admissions, lowered cost to taxpayers, and an end to the expensive and vicious cycle of crime and incarceration. ARI sites must utilize validated assessment instruments, invest in local evidence-based programs and services, report performance measurement data quarterly, reduce by 25% the number of individuals committed to IDOC from a defined target population, and agree to participate in required external evaluations. If the proposed program model for ARI implementation is a problem-solving court (PSC), the jurisdiction must either be certified or in the process of being certified through the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts (AOIC).

## Eligibility Information

Agencies must be pre-qualified through the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) Grantee Portal, https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/, to become eligible to apply for an award. Applicants must have completed the GATA pre-qualification process by **April 14, 2020** and received approval of their SFY21 Internal Control Questionnaire (ICQ), or the most recent fiscal year available, before the execution of the grant agreement.
