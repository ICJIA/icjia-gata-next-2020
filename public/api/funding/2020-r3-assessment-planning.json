{"body":"[LINK TO NOFO](R3PlanningNOFOINSTRUCTIONS.pdf) {.text-center .nofo-link}\n\nThe Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting proposals for grants for the Restore, Reinvest, and Renew (R3) program. Grants will be made with fiscal year 2021 funds made available to a trust fund established by The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act. A total of $3,150,000 in funding is available through this solicitation for use over a period of approximately 9 months. \n\n**July 20, 2020 at 11:59 pm.**\n\n## Program Requirements\n\nThe Assessment and Planning grant opportunity is available to communities who would like to develop a plan to build capacity within and between organizations to address the R3 Program Priorities most relevant to their communities. These Program Priorities, as established in The Cannabis Regulation and Trust Act, are 1.) Civil Legal Aid, 2.) Economic Development, 3.) Reentry, 4.) Violence Prevention, and 5.) Youth Development.\n\nOrganizations or collaboratives will develop a clear, well-defined process to assess and identify which of the R3 Program Priorities will be addressed in their communities. A final plan should include participation of community residents and stakeholders; require a unified vision and approach; utilize data and local experience and knowledge to define the community’s needs; and create concrete goals, objectives and performance measures to track progress of the program. The plan also may be used to apply for future funding, and, therefore, should not be directed toward a specific funding source. \n\nRefer to the NOFO for ALL Program Requirements.\n\n## Eligibility Information\n\nOnly programs serving a designated R3 zone are eligible to receive funding under this NOFO. Information on designated R3 zones is available via the interactive map at [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility). \n\nApplicants must be pre-qualified through the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) Grantee Portal, [https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/), to become eligible to apply for an award. Applicants must have completed the GATA pre-qualification process and received approval of the Internal Control Questionnaire (ICQ) SFY 2021, or the most recent fiscal year, before the execution of the grant agreement. Other members of a collaborative application submitted by another organization do not need to satisfy these requirements but must be otherwise eligible to receive state funds (see the Checklist at the bottom of page 1 of the NOFO for more information).\n   \n## Deadline\n\nCompleted application materials must be emailed to CJA.R3Planning@Illinois.gov and must be received by **11:59 p.m., July 20, 2020**, to be considered for funding. Proposals will not be accepted by mail, fax, or in-person. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed. Late submissions will not be reviewed.\n\n## Available Funds\n\nA total of $3,150,000 will be made available through this funding opportunity. Grants available through this funding opportunity are a portion of state FY2021 funds. Funding ranges vary by region and are specified in the NOFO and in the Program Narrative. \n\n## Period of Performance\n\nFunding is available for the period beginning with grant execution (estimated for September 21, 2020) through June 30, 2021. Based on program performance and fund availability, the ICJIA may recommend allocation of funding to support an additional 24 months.  \n\n## Technical Assistance Sessions\n\nIt is recommended that applicants participate in one of the three live webinars (links below; password is R3NOFO) or view the recordings of those webinars, which will be available on the ICJIA NOFO website and at the R3 website at [https://r3.illinois.gov/resources](https://r3.illinois.gov/resources) beginning on May 22, 2020, at 1:00 p.m.  \n\n[Webinar #1 (5/19/2020 from 2:00 to 3:00 pm)](https://illinois.webex.com/webappng/sites/illinois/meeting/info/b71623ba4d9d47f0bb28828338c62848_20200519T190000Z)\n[Webinar #2 (5/20/2020 from 2:00 to 3:00 pm)](https://illinois.webex.com/webappng/sites/illinois/meeting/info/b71623ba4d9d47f0bb28828338c62848_20200520T190000Z)\n[Webinar #3 (5/21/2020 from 10:00 to 11:00 am)](https://illinois.webex.com/webappng/sites/illinois/meeting/info/b71623ba4d9d47f0bb28828338c62848_20200521T190000Z)\n\nInformation provided during these webinar recordings will be unofficial and not binding on the state.\n\n## Notice of Intent\n\nAgencies interested in applying are asked to submit an online Notice of Intent by **11:59 p.m., July 6, 2020.**\n\n[Complete Notice of Intent](https://icjia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5uKwNBK3Vh5eDnT) {.text-center .noi-link} \n\n## Timeline\n\n|                           **Task**                        |      **Date**      |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------: |\n|                         NOFO Posted                       |   May 18, 2020 \t\t |\n|                    Webinar Sessions held                  |   May 19-21, 2020  |\n|            Technical Assistance Recording available       |   May 22, 2020     |\n|                     Notice of Intent due                  |   July 6, 2020     |\n|              NOFO question submission deadline            |   July 16, 2020    |\n|                     **Applications due**                  |**11:59 pm, July 20, 2020**|\n|Estimated date for R3 Board approval of recommended designations|   August 2020 |\n|Estimated date for Authority Budget Committee approval of recommended designations|   August 2020 |\n|                      Estimated program start date         | September 21, 2020 |\n\n## Reporting\n\nRecipients must submit monthly financial reports, quarterly performance data reports, final financial and performance reports, and, a calendar year end financial report in accordance with the CFR Part 200 Uniform Requirements.
