The other collaborative partners will be program subgrantees.

These and other applicant requirements are described in detail in the full Notice of Funding Opportunity.\n\n## Deadline\n\nCompleted application materials must be emailed to [CJA.VCRIC2021@Illinois.gov](mailto:CJA.VCRIC2021@Illinois.gov) by **3:00 p.m. CST, July 26, 2021,** to be considered for funding.
