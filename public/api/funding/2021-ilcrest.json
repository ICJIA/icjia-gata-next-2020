Grants will be supported with FFY19 Improving Criminal Justice Responses to Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking Grant from the Office on Violence Against Women at the U.S. Department of Justice. A total of \\$120,000 in funding is available through this solicitation for use over a period of 10 months.\n\n**Application deadline: August 6, 2021**\n\n## Program Requirements\n\nIllinois’ large, unified court system makes it difficult to develop one protocol that works for all 102 counties. Protocol implementation requires a multi-level, multi-disciplinary, localized approach, including continued follow-up and monitoring after implementation, for which the local Family Violence Coordinating Council (FVCC) structure is well qualified. Professionals in every aspect of the criminal justice system have multiple training mandates, little time for training, and limited resources. Providing a curriculum of training modules with an option for online access offers professionals statewide a viable option for training.\n\nThe goal of the CREST IL Project is to improve the criminal justice system response to domestic violence in communities across Illinois by promoting policy and procedural change, coordinated community response, and cross-training to encourage safety for people who experience family violence and accountability for people who perpetrate family violence.\n\n## Eligibility Information\n\nAgencies must be pre-qualified through the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) Grantee Portal, https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/, to become eligible to apply for an award. Applicants must be in good standing with all GATA pre-qualification requirements and received approval of the Internal Control Questionnaire (ICQ) SFY 22, and Programmatic Risk Assessment, before the execution of the grant agreement.\n\n## Eligible Applicants\n\nThis solicitation is open to public and not-for profit entities in Illinois. Advocacy agencies are not eligible to apply due to judicial ethic rules.\n\nEligible applicants include:\n\n- Government agencies, including local and county governments.\n- Educational institutions and regional offices of education.\n- Non-profit agencies, excluding advocacy agencies.\n\n## Deadline\n\nCompleted application materials must be emailed to cja.crestilpilot@illinois.gov by **5:00 p.m., August 6, 2021**, to be considered for funding.
