{"body":"## OVERVIEW\n\nTake the mystery out of securing state grant funding with an ICJIA Technical Assistance Workshop. ICJIA offers workshops throughout the state to ease the application process for organizations seeking grant funding. Participants will receive an overview of the ICJIA grant process and what it means to comply with the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA). GATA was created to ensure a coordinated, transparent process for efficient oversight of grant recipient selection and monitoring. The process also promotes quality programs and limits fraud, waste, and abuse.\n\nParticipants will learn: \n* How to pre-qualify for state grants.\n* Where to look for available grants.\n* What goes into a winning grant application.\n* General application submission guidelines and requirements. \n\nParticipants will leave with an understanding of the steps of the grant process and the importance of meeting GATA requirements. \n\n## WORKSHOP DESIGN\n\nTrained instructors will provide an interactive, four-hour curriculum in a classroom setting. Topics will include finding the right grant opportunity, being ready to apply, and completing and submitting a grant application. Workbooks will be provided. Participants are highly encouraged to bring their laptops and cell phones. \n\n## WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?\n\nICJIA offers Technical Assistance Workshops to the public in partnership with locally elected district officials.
