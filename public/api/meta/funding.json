Grants will be made with fiscal year 2021 funds made available to a trust fund established by The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act. A total of $3,150,000 in funding is available through this solicitation for use over a period of approximately 9 months. \n\n**July 20, 2020 at 11:59 pm.**\n\n## Program Requirements\n\nThe Assessment and Planning grant opportunity is available to communities who would like to develop a plan to build capacity within and between organizations to address the R3 Program Priorities most relevant to their communities. These Program Priorities, as established in The Cannabis Regulation and Trust Act, are 1.) Civil Legal Aid, 2.) Economic Development, 3.) Reentry, 4.) Violence Prevention, and 5.) Youth Development.\n\nOrganizations or collaboratives will develop a clear, well-defined process to assess and identify which of the R3 Program Priorities will be addressed in their communities. A final plan should include participation of community residents and stakeholders; require a unified vision and approach; utilize data and local experience and knowledge to define the community’s needs; and create concrete goals, objectives and performance measures to track progress of the program. The plan also may be used to apply for future funding, and, therefore, should not be directed toward a specific funding source. \n\nRefer to the NOFO for ALL Program Requirements.\n\n## Eligibility Information\n\nOnly programs serving a designated R3 zone are eligible to receive funding under this NOFO. Information on designated R3 zones is available via the interactive map at [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility). \n\nApplicants must be pre-qualified through the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) Grantee Portal, [https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/), to become eligible to apply for an award. Applicants must have completed the GATA pre-qualification process and received approval of the Internal Control Questionnaire (ICQ) SFY 2021, or the most recent fiscal year, before the execution of the grant agreement. Other members of a collaborative application submitted by another organization do not need to satisfy these requirements but must be otherwise eligible to receive state funds (see the Checklist at the bottom of page 1 of the NOFO for more information).\n   \n## Deadline\n\nCompleted application materials must be emailed to CJA.R3Planning@Illinois.gov and must be received by **11:59 p.m., July 20, 2020**, to be considered for funding. Proposals will not be accepted by mail, fax, or in-person. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed. Late submissions will not be reviewed.\n\n## Available Funds\n\nA total of $3,150,000 will be made available through this funding opportunity. Grants available through this funding opportunity are a portion of state FY2021 funds. Funding ranges vary by region and are specified in the NOFO and in the Program Narrative. \n\n## Period of Performance\n\nFunding is available for the period beginning with grant execution (estimated for September 21, 2020) through June 30, 2021. Based on program performance and fund availability, the ICJIA may recommend allocation of funding to support an additional 24 months.  \n\n## Technical Assistance Sessions\n\nIt is recommended that applicants view the recordings of at least one of three webinars (links below).

Grants will be made with FFY17 and FFY18 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funds. A total of \\$3.5 million in funding will be made available to support the JAG goal of reducing substance misuse and availability in Illinois communities.\n\n**Application deadline: 11:59 p.m., June 15, 2020**\n\n## Program Requirements\n\nApplicants may request funding under one or more categories of funding. A separate application must be completed for each category.\n\n#### Category 1: Law Enforcement Deflection Programs\n\nTo be eligible for funding, deflection programs must:\n\n- Be run by a local law enforcement agency, county sheriff’s department, or a multi-jurisdictional cooperative law enforcement unit for which an Implementing Agency has been identified.\n  - An Implementing Agency in this context is a government agency which will, on behalf of the multi-jurisdictional unit, apply for the grant, enter into the inter-governmental grant agreement with ICJIA, accept and account for grant funds, and meet all ICJIA reporting and compliance requirements.\n- Collaborate and partner with other police departments, if needed, to generate a wider pool of participants. Options may include:\n  - Sheriff’s departments.\n  - Single police departments that have sufficient volume within their own jurisdiction.\n  - A collaboration between multiple police departments where one agency serves as the lead and memorandums of understanding exist to show that one department will provide treatment coordination services to other jurisdictions. Partner agencies will refer participants to the lead and benefit from having the program as an option for their communities.\n- Have a full-time service coordinator. The coordinator will provide screening, intake, assessment of insurance coverage, and case management to program participants, and serve as a liaison with treatment providers to secure placements. The coordinator will also facilitate a “warm handoff” when clients arrive at the treatment center. A warm-handoff features a professional (coordinator, officer or trained volunteer) offering a face-to-face introduction of the client to the treatment provider.\n- Utilize the self-referral model with outreach. The program coordinator and police department must identify potential participants through community outreach, including speaking engagements to community organizations, churches, and health care providers, and establishing a presence in the community by reaching out in areas where potential participants or their families may be and offering information. The model must include:\n  - A plan to make potential clients and referral sources aware of the services available.\n  - A plan to coordinate program activities with community agencies in the service area, including substance abuse treatment, medical care and supportive service providers as well as relevant government agencies.\n- Provide training of police officers and development of intake protocol. The program must train officers on substance use disorders and the development of a protocol that will be followed when potential participants present at the police department.\n- Provide follow-up and aftercare.

Grants will be made with FY18 RSAT funds. A total of $700,000 in funding shall be made available to local government agencies for corrections-based or jail-based substance use disorder treatment or aftercare programs that meet the criteria detailed in the notice of funding opportunity for use over a period of 12 months.\n**Application deadline: October 31, 2019**\n\n## Program Requirements\n\nThis grant will fund programs in the following categories which are defined below.\n\n1. Corrections-based substance use disorder treatment\n2. Jail-based substance use disorder treatment\n3. Aftercare services\n\n### Corrections-based substance use disorder treatment\n\nPrograms must:\n\n- Engage participants for a period between six and 12 months.\n- Provide residential treatment facilities set apart from the general correctional population. This can be a completely separate facility or dedicated housing unit in a facility exclusively for RSAT participants.\n- Focus on the inmate’s substance use diagnosis and addiction-related needs.\n- Develop the inmate’s cognitive, behavioral, social, vocational, and other skills to solve the substance use and related problems.\n- Require urinalysis and/or other proven reliable forms of drug and alcohol testing for program participants, including both periodic and random testing, and for former participants while they remain in the custody of the state or local government.\n- Prepare participants for successful community reintegration, including post-release referral to appropriate evidence-based aftercare treatment and service providers that support the use of medication-assisted treatment.\n\nIf possible, RSAT participation should be limited to inmates with six to 12 months remaining in their confinement so they can be released from prison instead of returning to the general prison population after completing the program.\nProgram design must be based on effective, scientific practices.\n\n### Jail-based substance use disorder treatment\n\nPrograms must:\n\n- Engage participants for at least three months.\n- Focus on the inmate’s substance use diagnosis and addiction-related needs.\n- Develop the inmate’s cognitive, behavioral, social, vocational, and other skills to solve the substance use and related problems with emphasis on the provision of cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n- Require urinalysis and/or other proven reliable forms of drug and alcohol testing for program participants, including both periodic and random testing, and for former participants while they remain in the custody of the state or local government.\n- Prepare participants for successful community reintegration, including post-release referral to appropriate evidence-based aftercare treatment and service providers that support the use of medication assisted treatment.\n- If possible, jail-based programs should separate the treatment population from the general correctional population and program design should be based on effective, scientific practices.\n\n### Aftercare Services\n\nSubstance use disorder treatment, established or implemented with assistance provided under RSAT, must provide aftercare services.\n\nPrograms must:\n\n- Involve coordination between the correctional treatment program, post-release supervision officer, and other social service and rehabilitation programs and services.\n- Work in conjunction with state and local authorities and organizations involved in substance use disorder treatment to assist in the placement of program participants into community substance use disorder treatment programs or services on release.\n- Provide reentering individuals with comprehensive care coordination prior to and upon release from the facility. This includes a comprehensive reentry plan for aftercare services, other needs, and resources. It is most successfully accomplished when institution staff initiates linkages with aftercare agencies and services outside of the institution, including social services and/or treatment services, parole, and case management [1]. Continuity between prison and community can reduce re-offense rates [2].\n\nIn addition:\n\n- To qualify as an aftercare program, the head of the substance use disorder treatment program must work in conjunction with state and local authorities and organizations involved in substance use disorder treatment to assist in the placement of program participants into community substance use disorder treatment programs or services on release.\n\nEffective correctional and aftercare programming is most effective if they are **_structured, cognitive-behavioral, and skills-based._** Approaches such as Alcoholics Anonymous or faith/spiritual-based services do not meet the standard for correctional or treatment programs [3].\n\n1.

A total of $ 800,000 in funding is available through this solicitation for use over a period of 12 months.\n\n**Application deadline: July 8,2019.**\n\nIn 2017, the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority was awarded a Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth Demonstration grant from the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice [1]. The demonstration project seeks to address the needs of child and youth victims [2] and their families [3] by identifying young crime victims, coordinating prevention and intervention services post-victimization, and building capacity within communities to provide needed services and support.\n\nThe overarching vision for Illinois HEALS (Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems) is to alleviate the burden of finding services to address victimization by ensuring appropriate care and services are made available to all victims regardless of the door they first enter, whether it is a doctor’s office, school, or local police station or sheriff’s office.\n\n1. Illinois is one of four states designated as a demonstration site.\n2. We acknowledge that the term victim does not resonate with everyone who has experienced violence. Some prefer the term survivor or person impacted by violence. We encourage people and communities to use terms that best reflect their experiences.\n   Throughout this document we use the terms children and youth and young persons to refer to individuals from birth to 25 years of age.\n3. For reading ease, throughout this document we use the term family or family members to refer to the adults and other individuals who may live with and/or provide primary care for children and youth. These individuals or adults may include biological relatives (e.g., siblings, adults/uncles, grandparents, parents) and other caregivers (e.g., foster families, other non-relative adults).\n\n## Program Requirements\n\n- Strive to integrate the Illinois HEALS Mission, Values and Principles as outlined in this solicitation.\n- Implement the project goals as described in this solicitation and in the program narrative.\n- Hire and supervise the staff positions outlined in the program narrative.\n- Meet regularly with ICJIA Illinois HEALS staff to discuss implementation.
