# Adult Redeploy Client

Adult Redeploy Illinois was established by the Crime Reduction Act (Public Act 96-0761) to provide financial incentives to local jurisdictions for programs that allow diversion of individuals from state prisons by providing community-based services. Grants are provided to counties, groups of counties, and judicial circuits to increase programming in their areas, in exchange for reducing the number of people they send to the Illinois Department of Corrections.

The Crime Reduction Act is based on the premise that crime can be reduced and the costs of the criminal justice system can be controlled by understanding and addressing the reasons why people commit crimes. It also acknowledges that local jurisdictions know best what resources are necessary to reduce crime in their communities. Rigorous evaluation processes with standardized performance measurements are required to confirm the effectiveness of services in reducing crime.

The Adult Redeploy Illinois program is an example of a national best practice called "performance incentive funding." Adult Redeploy Illinois is based on the successful juvenile model which has been operating since 2004 with positive results.

Results expected with Adult Redeploy Illinois include reduced prison overcrowding (based on other states' experiences, with no increase in crime); lowered cost to taxpayers ($28,000 a year for prison vs. $3,500 on average for drug treatment); an end to the expensive vicious cycle of crime and incarceration.
