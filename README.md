# ICJIA GATA Client

> The Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) of 2014, 30 ILCS 708/1 et seq., increased accountability and transparency in the use of grant funds and reduced the administrative burden on state agencies and grantees through adoption of federal grant guidelines and regulations.

> GATA requires grants administered by Executive branch state agencies to be awarded via a competitive bidding process. In addition, all applicants must undergo a registration and pre-award screening process. This competitive grant award process is initiated with a Notice of Funding Opportunity.
