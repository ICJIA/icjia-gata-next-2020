The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting proposals for grants for the Restore, Reinvest, and Renew (R3) program. Grants will be made with fiscal year 2021 funds made available to a trust fund established by The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act. A total of $3,150,000 in funding is available through this solicitation for use over a period of approximately 9 months. 

**July 20, 2020 at 11:59 pm.**

## Program Requirements

The Assessment and Planning grant opportunity is available to communities who would like to develop a plan to build capacity within and between organizations to address the R3 Program Priorities most relevant to their communities. These Program Priorities, as established in The Cannabis Regulation and Trust Act, are 1.) Civil Legal Aid, 2.) Economic Development, 3.) Reentry, 4.) Violence Prevention, and 5.) Youth Development.

Organizations or collaboratives will develop a clear, well-defined process to assess and identify which of the R3 Program Priorities will be addressed in their communities. A final plan should include participation of community residents and stakeholders; require a unified vision and approach; utilize data and local experience and knowledge to define the community’s needs; and create concrete goals, objectives and performance measures to track progress of the program. The plan also may be used to apply for future funding, and, therefore, should not be directed toward a specific funding source. 

Please refer to the NOFO for all Program Requirements.

## Eligibility Information

Only programs serving a designated R3 zone are eligible to receive funding under this NOFO. Information on designated R3 zones is available via the interactive map at [https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility](https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility). 

Applicants must be pre-qualified through the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) Grantee Portal, [https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/), to become eligible to apply for an award. Applicants must have completed the GATA pre-qualification process and received approval of the Internal Control Questionnaire (ICQ) SFY 2021, or the most recent fiscal year, before the execution of the grant agreement. Other members of a collaborative application submitted by another organization do not need to satisfy these requirements but must be otherwise eligible to receive state funds (see the Checklist at the bottom of page 1 of the NOFO for more information).
   
## Deadline

Completed application materials must be emailed to CJA.R3Planning@Illinois.gov and must be received by **11:59 p.m., July 20, 2020**, to be considered for funding. Proposals will not be accepted by mail, fax, or in-person. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed. Late submissions will not be reviewed.

## Available Funds

A total of $3,150,000 will be made available through this funding opportunity. Grants available through this funding opportunity are a portion of state FY2021 funds. Funding ranges vary by region and are specified in the NOFO and in the Program Narrative. 

## Period of Performance

Funding is available for the period beginning with grant execution (estimated for September 21, 2020) through June 30, 2021. Based on program performance and fund availability, the ICJIA may recommend allocation of funding to support an additional 24 months.
