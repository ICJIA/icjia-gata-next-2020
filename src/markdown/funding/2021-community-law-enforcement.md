**Application deadline: July 22, 2021, 11:59 pm.**

## Program Requirements

Applicants may request funding under one or more categories. 

**Model 1:** *Post-Overdose Response*: This model features a response initiated by a law enforcement officer/other first responder after emergency administration of medication to reverse overdose. The post-overdose response may be multi-disciplinary and may include the distribution of naloxone if there is no other source of funding, in-person contact, relationship building, and access to treatment. Example: Quick Response Team.

**Model 2:** *Self-Referral Response*: This response is initiated by an individual by going to a police station or otherwise contacting a police officer or law enforcement agency or other first responder and acknowledging their own substance misuse and need for treatment. The response offers individuals assistance in obtaining substance use disorder treatment. Examples: Safe Passage, A Way Out.

**Model 3:** *Active Outreach Response:* This response is initiated by a police officer or other first responder through proactive identification of persons likely to misuse substances or have a substance use disorder. Law enforcement intentionally seeks out and identifies individuals who may need help, and a warm handoff is made to a service provider who engages them in treatment. 

**Model 4:** *Community Engagement Response*: This response is initiated by a police officer or law enforcement agency or other first responder in response to a notification from a community member when no criminal charges are present.

**Model 5:** *Officer Intervention Response*: These are commonly referred to as pre-arrest diversion programs. The response occurs when criminal charges are present but held in abeyance or citations issued with requirement of treatment. 

An Implementing Agency must apply for funds on behalf of a law enforcement agency or other entity as described below. To be eligible for funding, diversion/deflection programs must:

- Be run by a municipal law enforcement agency/other first responder agency, county sheriffâ€™s office of this State, Department of State Police, or other law enforcement agency whose officers, by statute, are granted and authorized by Public Act 100-1025 to exercise powers like those conferred upon any peace officer employed by a law enforcement agency of this State. Private and non-profit entities are not eligible to apply.
  - An Implementing Agency in this context is a government agency which will apply for the grant, enter into the inter-governmental grant agreement with ICJIA, accept and account for grant funds, and meet all ICJIA reporting and compliance requirements.

The law enforcement agency or other first responder, licensed treatment providers, and community members or organizations shall:

-	Establish a local deflection program plan to make potential clients and referral sources aware of the services available. 
-	Have a plan to coordinate program activities with community agencies in the service area, including substance abuse treatment, medical care and supportive service providers, behavioral health providers, and relevant government agencies.

## Eligibility Information

Agencies must be pre-qualified through the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) Grantee Portal, [https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/ ](https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/), to become eligible to apply for an award. During pre-qualification, Dun and Bradstreet verifications are performed, including a check of Debarred and Suspended status and good standing with the Secretary of State. Applicants must have completed the GATA pre-qualification process by the date of application.
Applicants will also be required to submit a financial and administrative risk assessment utilizing an Internal Controls Questionnaire (ICQ) for SFY21/22 and obtain approval from their cognizant agencies before execution of the grant agreement. Delay in obtaining SFY21/22 ICQ approval will result in a delay in grant execution.
